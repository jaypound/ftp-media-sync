# AI Analysis Failure Investigation Report

## Executive Summary

The investigation revealed that **AI analysis failures are not actual failures** - they are assets that were intentionally analyzed with AI analysis disabled.

## Key Findings

### 1. Root Cause
- Assets with substantial transcripts (>500 characters) but empty summaries were analyzed when `ai_analysis_enabled = False`
- This is not a bug but expected behavior when AI analysis is disabled in the configuration

### 2. Statistics
- **Total assets**: 220
- **Assets with transcripts >500 chars**: 81
- **Assets analyzed with AI disabled**: 52 (33 have transcripts)
- **Assets analyzed with AI enabled**: 168 (48 have transcripts)
- **Success rate when AI enabled**: 44 out of 48 (91.7%)

### 3. Affected Content Types
Content types most affected (100% failure rate):
- `mtg` (meetings) - 17 assets
- `an` (announcements) - 4 assets
- `other` - 2 assets
- `lm`, `atld`, `pkg`, `bmp` - 1-2 assets each

### 4. Timeline Pattern
All assets with empty summaries were created between July 21, 2025 and September 10, 2025, indicating a period when AI analysis was disabled.

## Technical Details

### How AI Analysis Works
1. File is downloaded and audio is extracted
2. Transcript is generated from audio
3. **IF** `ai_config.enabled = True`:
   - AI analyzes the transcript
   - Generates summary, engagement score, topics, etc.
4. **IF** `ai_config.enabled = False`:
   - AI analysis is skipped
   - Summary and engagement fields remain empty
5. Asset is marked as `analysis_completed = True` regardless

### Database Evidence
```sql
-- Assets with AI disabled have empty summaries
ai_analysis_enabled = False: 33 assets with transcripts, 33 empty summaries (100%)
-- Assets with AI enabled rarely have empty summaries  
ai_analysis_enabled = True: 48 assets with transcripts, 4 empty summaries (8.3%)
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Reanalyze Existing Content
To fix the assets with transcripts but no AI analysis:
```python
# Identify assets needing reanalysis
SELECT id, content_title 
FROM assets 
WHERE LENGTH(transcript) > 500 
  AND ai_analysis_enabled = FALSE
  AND (summary = '' OR summary IS NULL)
```

### 2. Enable AI Analysis
Ensure AI analysis is enabled in the configuration:
- Check `/api/ai-config` endpoint
- Verify API keys are configured
- Set `enabled: true` in AI analysis settings

### 3. Batch Reanalysis
Use the existing "force reanalysis" feature to reprocess these assets with AI enabled.

### 4. Add Monitoring
Consider adding alerts or reports for:
- Assets analyzed without AI when transcripts exist
- AI analysis success/failure rates
- Assets missing engagement scores

## Conclusion

The "failed" AI analyses are actually successful file analyses that were performed with AI analysis intentionally disabled. The system is working as designed. To add AI analysis to these assets, they need to be reanalyzed with AI enabled.
