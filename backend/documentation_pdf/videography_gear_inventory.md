# Videography Gear Inventory & Best Use Cases

## Documentary + Short-Form Content Creation (Performance Review Talking Points)

### Purpose & Context

In addition to my broadcast-engineering role, I maintain a professional cinematography kit that has supported several City communications and operations projects over time. The first use was for temporary broadcasts from the former City Council chambers, followed by Holiday Greetings, and most recently the ongoing Castus training videos. This equipment has helped maintain image quality, consistency, and flexibility while working in non-ideal or evolving production environments.

## Lens Inventory & Creative Use

### Wide & Establishing
**16–35mm f/2.8**  
Establishing shots, interiors, and situational context—especially useful in temporary spaces.

### Standard Documentary Coverage
**24–70mm f/2.8**  
Primary workhorse for interviews, b-roll, and walk-and-talk segments.

### Telephoto & Detail
**70–200mm f/2.8**  
Candid moments, compressed interview framing, and emotional close-ups without intruding on subjects.

**Sigma 60–600mm f/4.5–6.3 DG DN OS Sports**  
Tight shots of council members in large chambers or committee rooms where cameras must remain at a distance.

*Why it works well:*
- Extremely long reach enables close, readable framing without disrupting proceedings
- Optical stabilization supports handheld, monopod, or locked-off use
- Particularly valuable in large rooms or overflow spaces with fixed camera positions

### Cinematic Prime Lenses
- **35mm f/1.4** – Natural perspective for immersive documentary scenes
- **50mm f/1.2** – Subject isolation and emphasis
- **85mm f/1.4** – Polished portrait and interview framing

Prime lenses help separate subjects from the background, giving short-form and training content a more intentional look.

### Specialty Zooms
- **28–70mm f/2.0** – Low-light flexibility with zoom convenience
- **50–150mm f/2.0** – Strong compression and subject isolation for interviews
- **FE PZ 28–135mm f/4.0** – Power zoom and broadcast-style operation, well suited for training videos and controlled camera moves

- Soft, motivated documentary lighting in non-studio environments

**Why it works well:**

## Camera Movement & Visual Polish

### iFootage Shark Nano II – 26″ Motorized Camera Slider

**Best suited for:**
- Subtle motion in interviews and training videos
- Adding visual interest to static shots without increasing crew size

**Why it works well:**
- Motorized, repeatable moves for consistent results
- Compact and quick to deploy in offices, council spaces, or temporary setups
- Elevates short-form and instructional content with minimal complexity
