"""Debug why Live Input shows 4:58 duration instead of 3:05"""

# The issue:
# - Meeting: 6:00 PM to 9:05 PM (should be 3:05 duration)
# - Template shows: 18:00:00.000 with 04:58:00.000 duration
# - This causes overlap detection to fail

print("Possible causes:")
print("1. When the meeting was imported, '9:05 PM' was misread as '10:58 PM'")

print("\nMost likely scenario:")
